        <span style="font-size:65px;line-height:1;">B</span>ollywood, Tollywood or Follywood, it is the men who rule the roost and call the shots. Hence when ‘Lady Superstar’ Nayanthara emerged in the Tamil film industry as a force to reckon with, there was widespread resentment among her male colleagues.
        They would express happiness about Nayanthara’s stardom in public and seethe in anger when the lights went down. It is a matter of great admiration that Nayanthara has opted to expose a male colleague for his pettiness. That the colleague happens to be Dhanush would surprise only those who don’t know the actor well.
        A female star who has worked with Dhanush says, “Outwardly he is kind and courteous with co-stars. But the minute he feels threatened by a co-star’s presence, he gets uppity. He is not alone. A majority of actors in Tamil do not like being overshadowed by their female co-stars.”
